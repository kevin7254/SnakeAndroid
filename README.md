# SnakeAndroid
My implementation of a simple Snake Game for Android using MVVM and
Kotlin Coroutines.

Some known bugs are present, which are included but not limited to:
* Score not working.
* Swiping controls buggy.
* Apple can sometimes spawn outside the border.
* Snake body is not pixel perfect making it possible for half the snake
to run against the border.
* Visual bugs.


## TODO:
* Fix bugs.
* Update visuals
* Add main menu, stats etc.
* Improve pause/reload logic.
* Improve controls.
* Add powerups
